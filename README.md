## Run the tasks

Check the `tasks` folder to see an extensive list of built tasks to interact with the wallet. You can also run `yarn hardhat --help` or `yarn hardhat help <TASK>` to get information about a task.

Spin up your local blockchain:
```
yarn hardhat node
```

```
yarn hardhat <TASK> --network localhost
// or
yarn hardhat <TASK> <PARAM1, PARAM2...> --network localhost 
```

## Verify on Etherscan

If you deploy your contracts to a testnet or mainnet, you can verify them if you get an [API Key](https://etherscan.io/login?cmd=last) from Etherscan and set it as an environemnt variable with the name `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`. You can pop it into your `.env` file as seen in the `.env.example`.

However, you also can manually verify with:

```
yarn hardhat verify <DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> --constructor-args
```

In it's current state, if you have your api key set, it will auto verify contract deployed on Sepolia.
